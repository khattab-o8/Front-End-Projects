# Forkify Project!🍕

Forkify is a web app designed to make discovering and managing recipes easier and it’s connected to an external API for live data . Here’s what it can do:

• 🔍 Search recipes for anything like pizza, burger, and more.

• 📄 Paginated results make navigating through recipes simple and organized.

• 📋 Detailed recipe views show cooking time, servings, ingredients, and an external link for more info.

• 🔢 Adjustable servings: Change the number of servings and watch the ingredients update automatically.

• 🔖 Bookmark your favorites and store them locally in your browser.

• 📝 Add your own recipes, and they’ll be automatically bookmarked and also has a custom user icon.

I structured Forkify using the MVC architecture, which helped separate logic, user interaction, and data management into clean, organized layers.
